abstract={Doolittle HA, Norton SA, Bacon LC, Ewing HA, Amirbahman A. 2018. The internal and watershed controls on hypolimnetic sediment phosphorus release in Lake Auburn, Maine, USA. Lake Reserv Manage. 00:00–00. Lake Auburn, Maine, USA, is a historically oligotrophic lake serving as a drinking water source. In 2011–2012, epilimnetic total phosphorus (P) concentrations, turbidity, and cyanobacteria blooms increased. This water quality decline was linked to earlier onset, and increased extent, of late-summer hypolimnetic anoxia, causing internal P loading from lake sediment. This study evaluated chemical P speciation in hypolimnetic sediment, using the Psenner method for sequential chemical extractions, and watershed roles in controlling sediment P release. Surficial sediments (0–2 cm) are high in reducible Fe hydroxide (107–1267 µmol/g) and associated P (15–103 µmol/g), and relatively low in Al hydroxide (77–242 µmol/g). Previous research has shown sediment with molar Al:reducible Fe ratios <3 and Al hydroxide:reducible Fe-bound P < 25 to act as a source of P during anoxia. Lake Auburn surface sediment has molar Al hydroxide:reducible Fe hydroxide ratios between 0.2 and 1.7, and molar Al hydroxide:reducible Fe hydroxide-bound P ratios between 2.0 and 14.5, indicating high risk for internal P loading. Al concentration decreases downstream from catchment lakes and along Lake Auburn tributaries, while Fe export from upstream wetlands is high. The decrease in Al and proportionately greater increase in Fe flux to the lake and in-lake deposition of Al and Fe hydroxides are impacting sediment chemistry, increasing the lake's vulnerability to eutrophication following the onset of hypolimnetic anoxia. Understanding the significance of these critical sediment ratios and influences from watershed sources is imperative for lake managers dealing with systems having significant internal recycling of phosphorus. © 2018, © Copyright by the North American Lake Management Society 2018.},

abstract={Mercury (Hg) concentrations in aquatic environments have increased globally, exposing consumers of aquatic organisms to high Hg levels. For both aquatic and terrestrial consumers, exposure to Hg depends on their food sources as well as environmental factors influencing Hg bioavailability. The majority of the research on the transfer of methylmercury (MeHg), a toxic and bioaccumulating form of Hg, between aquatic and terrestrial food webs has focused on terrestrial piscivores. However, a gap exists in our understanding of the factors regulating MeHg bioaccumulation by non-piscivorous terrestrial predators, specifically consumers of adult aquatic insects. Because dissolved organic carbon (DOC) binds tightly to MeHg, affecting its transport and availability in aquatic food webs, we hypothesized that DOC affects MeHg transfer from stream food webs to terrestrial predators feeding on emerging adult insects. We tested this hypothesis by collecting data over 2 years from 10 low-order streams spanning a broad DOC gradient in the Lake Sunapee watershed in New Hampshire, USA. We found that streamwater MeHg concentration increased linearly with DOC concentration. However, streams with the highest DOC concentrations had emerging stream prey and spiders with lower MeHg concentrations than streams with intermediate DOC concentrations; a pattern that is similar to fish and larval aquatic insects. Furthermore, high MeHg concentrations found in spiders show that MeHg transfer in adult aquatic insects is an overlooked but potentially significant pathway of MeHg bioaccumulation in terrestrial food webs. Our results suggest that although MeHg in water increases with DOC, MeHg concentrations in stream and terrestrial consumers did not consistently increase with increases in streamwater MeHg concentrations. In fact, there was a change from a positive to a negative relationship between aqueous exposure and bioaccumulation at streamwater MeHg concentrations associated with DOC above ∼5 mg/L. Thus, our study highlights the importance of stream DOC for MeHg dynamics beyond stream boundaries, and shows that factors modulating MeHg bioavailability in aquatic systems can affect the transfer of MeHg to terrestrial predators via aquatic subsidies. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Tropical timberlines are dynamic ecotones influenced not only by climate but often also by human activity. Understanding differences in soils across these boundaries therefore requires explicit consideration of land use. We examined patterns of soil and fine root chemistry at a tropical timberline ecotone in northern Peru nearly three decades after grazing and fire reduction. Soils were collected in forest, edge, and grassland habitat on east- and west-facing slopes and evidence of recent grazing, past fire, and shrub presence was recorded in alpine grasslands. We determined concentrations and mass (to 10cm) of base cations, phosphorus (P), and inorganic nitrogen (N) in soil, as well as total carbon (C), total N, δ13C, and δ15N in soils and fine roots. Calcium and magnesium concentrations and mass, and soil P and fine root N concentrations decreased from forest to grassland. Lower soil P, soil N, and fine root N concentrations were associated with enriched soil δ15N, indicating enhanced nutrient losses from edge and grassland soils. The stable carbon isotopic composition of soils and fine roots was more enriched in grassland (soil δ13C=-24.1‰; fine root δ13C=-25.1‰) compared to forest (soil δ13C=-26.1‰; fine root δ13C=-28.2‰), except where shrubs were present. In grasslands, topography appeared to influence grazing and shrub expansion; shrubs were more prevalent on the steeper west-facing slopes while cattle dung was found only on the shallower east-facing slopes. The spatially heterogeneous patterns of shrub establishment and surface soil and fine root chemistry across these forest-grassland boundaries provide evidence of legacies of grazing and burning, underscoring the need for further research on land-use legacy effects on belowground processes in tropical timberline ecosystems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Here we draw attention to the potential for pelagic bloom-forming cyanobacteria to have substantial effects on nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience across a wide range of lakes. Specifically, we hypothesize that cyanobacterial blooms can influence lake nutrient cycling, resilience, and regime shifts by tapping into pools of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) not usually accessible to phytoplankton. The ability of many cyanobacterial taxa to fix dissolved N2 gas is a well-known potential source of N, but some taxa can also access pools of P in sediments and bottom waters. Both of these nutrients can be released to the water column via leakage or mortality, thereby increasing nutrient availability for other phytoplankton and microbes. Moreover, cyanobacterial blooms are not restricted to high nutrient (eutrophic) lakes: blooms also occur in lakes with low nutrient concentrations, suggesting that changes in nutrient cycling and ecosystem resilience mediated by cyanobacteria could affect lakes across a gradient of nutrient concentrations. We used a simple model of coupled N and P cycles to explore the effects of cyanobacteria on nutrient dynamics and resilience. Consistent with our hypothesis, parameters reflecting cyanobacterial modification of N and P cycling alter the number, location, and/or stability of model equilibria. In particular, the model demonstrates that blooms of cyanobacteria in low-nutrient conditions can facilitate a shift to the high-nutrient state by reducing the resilience of the low-nutrient state. This suggests that cyanobacterial blooms warrant attention as potential drivers of the transition from a low-nutrient, clearwater regime to a high-nutrient, turbid-water regime, a prediction of particular concern given that such blooms are reported to be increasing in many regions of the world due in part to global climate change. © 2015 Cottingham et al.},

abstract={A defining feature of the redwood forest in coastal California is the presence of fog in the summer months, a time when there is typically little rainfall. Our goal was to determine the role of summer fog in canopy transformation of nitrogen, nitrogen uptake by trees and photosynthesis within a coastal redwood forest ecosystem. We measured horizontal and vertical inputs of nitrogen, the isotopic composition of nitrogen in a variety of atmospheric sources (summer fog, winter rain and throughfall throughout the year), nitrogen pools (soil solution) and plant tissue (roots and foliage), as well as rates of photosynthesis and nitrogen uptake by trees. Throughfall nitrogen fluxes were greater at the forest edge compared to the interior both within the canopy (sampled 10m above-ground) and onto the forest floor (sampled 1m above-ground; P&lt;0.05). Similarly, soil solution NO3- and total inorganic nitrogen were greater at the forest edge compared to the interior (P=0.0014 and 0.009, respectively). Whereas natural abundance δ15NO3 values were not significantly different between winter rain (measured as bulk precipitation) and summer fog water (average δ15N=-1.2±0.680/00), δ15NH4 values were significantly greater in fog water (11.4±2.70/00) compared to rain (1.2±0.90/00). We found no difference in δ15N in roots from forest edge trees compared to interior trees. In contrast, nitrogen concentrations and δ15N in foliage from forest edge trees were significantly greater compared to interior trees (P&lt;0.0001), suggesting that the leaves of forest edge trees may be obtaining a greater proportion of their nitrogen from fog compared to those of the interior trees. Natural abundance 13C of leaf sugars and rates of photosynthesis were significantly higher at the forest edge compared to the interior during the fog season (P&lt;0.05), but not different between locations in the rain season (P&gt;0.05). Nitrification in the forest floor, rather than the canopy, is the primary source of NO3- in these soils throughout the year. Synthesis. Summer fog provides nitrogen directly and indirectly to redwood trees, especially those at the forest edge, and affects the physiologic function of redwood trees.

abstract={Invasive exotic earthworms are significantly influencing understory community composition, soil, and ecosystem processes in northern hardwood forests in North America, but their effect on the retention of nitrogen (N) has been inconclusive. We examined this in two northern hardwood forest sites in New York state, USA through a tracer study. In both spring and fall, we added tracer amounts of 15N as nitrate—to simulate atmospheric deposition—with the biologically less active tracer bromide (Br−) to areas both with and without large populations of invasive earthworms. Total recovery of 15N was lower in earthworm-invaded plots, largely due to less retention in litter and upper soil horizons. Although the strong relationship between retention in the upper soil horizons and total 15N recovery suggests that earthworm destruction of the forest floor may be one mechanism reducing the capacity for N retention, in some cases the mineral soil in earthworm-invaded plots retained substantial N. Biotic pools, particularly litter and microbial biomass, retained significantly less 15N in earthworm-invaded plots than in their uninvaded counterparts. In plots invaded by earthworms, negative effects of earthworms on trees were revealed through root-uptake assays suggesting somewhat greater plant demand for ammonium in the spring and in lower 15N recovery in maple seedlings the year following tracer addition. Although similar patterns of Br− movement across treatments suggested that earthworms had smaller effects on hydrologic tracer movement than expected, they appear to have significant effects on the biological processes that underlie N retention. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Concurrent changes in climate, atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, and increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) affect ecosystems in complex ways. The DayCent-Chem model was used to investigate the combined effects of these human-caused drivers of change over the period 1980-2075 at seven forested montane and two alpine watersheds in the United States. Net ecosystem production (NEP) increased linearly with increasing N deposition for six out of seven forested watersheds; warming directly increased NEP at only two of these sites. Warming reduced soil organic carbon storage at all sites by increasing heterotrophic respiration. At most sites, warming together with high N deposition increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions enough to negate the greenhouse benefit of soil carbon sequestration alone, though there was a net greenhouse gas sink across nearly all sites mainly due to the effect of CO2 fertilization and associated sequestration by plants. Over the simulation period, an increase in atmospheric CO2 from 350 to 600 ppm was the main driver of change in net ecosystem greenhouse gas sequestration at all forested sites and one of two alpine sites, but an additional increase in CO2 from 600 to 760 ppm produced smaller effects. Warming either increased or decreased net greenhouse gas sequestration, depending on the site. The N contribution to net ecosystem greenhouse gas sequestration averaged across forest sites was only 5-7 % and was negligible for the alpine. Stream nitrate (NO3 -) fluxes increased sharply with N-loading, primarily at three watersheds where initial N deposition values were high relative to terrestrial N uptake capacity. The simulated results displayed fewer synergistic responses to warming, N-loading, and CO2 fertilization than expected. Overall, simulations with DayCent-Chem suggest individual site characteristics and historical patterns of N deposition are important determinants of forest or alpine ecosystem responses to global change. © 2014 US Government.},

abstract={Recruitment from dormant stages in the benthos can provide a critically important inoculum for surface populations of phytoplankton, including bloom-forming cyanobacteria. For example, water-column populations of the large (1-3-mm diameter) colonial cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata (Smith) P. Richter can be strongly subsidized by benthic recruitment. Therefore, understanding controls on recruitment is essential to an investigation of the factors controlling Gloeotrichia blooms, which are increasing in low-nutrient lakes across northeastern North America. We quantified surface abundances and recruitment from littoral sediments at multiple near-shore sampling sites in oligotrophic Lake Sunapee, New Hampshire, USA, during the summers of 2005-2012 and used this data set - the longest known record of cyanobacterial recruitment - to investigate potential drivers of interannual differences in Gloeotrichia recruitment. We found extensive spatiotemporal variability in recruitment. Recruitment was higher at some sites than others, and within seasons, recruitment into replicate traps at the same site was generally more similar than recruitment at different sites. These data suggest that local factors, such as substrate quality or the size of the seed bank, may be important controls on recruitment. Benthic recruitment probably accounted for <4%, but possibly up to 8%, of pelagic populations, within the range observed in previous studies. Across years, higher seasonal recruitment rates were associated with greater lake mixing during August, including deeper thermoclines, lower Schmidt stability, lower minimum air temperatures, and greater variability in water temperature. Taken together, our data suggest that interannual variation in Gloeotrichia recruitment may be related to regional climatic variability. © 2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science.},

abstract={Cyanobacterial blooms are increasing in lakes, both eutrophic and oligotrophic, in many parts of the world. Freshwater cyanobacteria generally have negative effects on eukaryotic phytoplankton in eutrophic systems because of their ability to form dense surface aggregations (scums) that reduce light availability. However, less is known about the effects of cyanobacteria on other phytoplankton in oligotrophic lakes. Because Gloeotrichia echinulata, a large colonial cyanobacterium, has been increasingly observed in low-nutrient lakes in the northeastern USA and Canada, we investigated its effects on phytoplankton biomass and community structure. In field and laboratory experiments, high densities of Gloeotrichia had significant positive effects on the biomass of small phytoplankton (<30 μm, typically considered edible to zooplankton) relative to no-Gloeotrichia controls. Interestingly, Gloeotrichia also increased phytoplankton taxa richness and Shannon diversity, primarily by stimulating the richness and biovolume of Bacillariophyta (diatoms) and Chlorophyta (green algae). Our laboratory experiment further suggests that at high densities, Gloeotrichia may have stimulated the other phytoplankton by leaking nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, this study suggests that continued increases in Gloeotrichia in low-nutrient lakes are likely to increase phytoplankton biomass and alter community structure in these systems. © The Author 2013.

abstract={We describe a collaboration between mathematicians and ecologists studying the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata and its possible role in eutrophication of New England lakes. The mathematics includes compartmental modeling, differential equations, difference equations, and testing models against high-frequency data. The ecology includes observation, field sampling, and parameter estimation based on observed data and the related literature. Mathematically and ecologically, a collaboration like this progresses in ways it never would have if either group worked alone.},

abstract={To date, most research on cyanobacterial blooms has focused on high-nutrient, not low-nutrient lakes. We investigated reports of the cyanobacterium Gloeotrichia echinulata in lakes with low concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus across the northeastern United States by surveying selected oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes during four summers. G. echinulata is a large (1-3 mm diameter) colonial cyanobacterium that may have substantial effects on low-nutrient lakes used for drinking water and recreation because it can produce the toxin microcystin-LR. We found G. echinulata in the water column of 27 out of 37 lakes we sampled in Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont. G. echinulata densities were typically low (&lt;5 colonies L -1), but occasionally at surface scum-producing levels (up to 250 colonies L -1). G. echinulata colonies from the survey lakes exhibited detectable microcystin-LR concentrations ranging from 58 to 7,148 ng microcystin-LR g -1 dry weight colonies. If G. echinulata densities increase to bloom levels observed in eutrophic systems, our data suggest that the microcystin-LR concentrations attributable to G. echinulata may reach levels known to influence aquatic organisms and pose human health risks. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Here we document the regional effects of Tropical Cyclone Irene on thermal structure and ecosystem metabolism in nine lakes and reservoirs in northeastern North America using a network of high-frequency, in situ, automated sensors. Thermal stability declined within hours in all systems following passage of Irene, and the magnitude of change was related to the volume of water falling on the lake and catchment relative to lake volume. Across systems, temperature change predicted the change in primary production, but changes in mixed-layer thickness did not affect metabolism. Instead, respiration became a driver of ecosystem metabolism that was decoupled from in-lake primary production, likely due to addition of terrestrially derived carbon. Regionally, energetic disturbance of thermal structure was shorter-lived than disturbance from inflows of terrestrial materials. Given predicted regional increases in intense rain events with climate change, the magnitude and longevity of ecological impacts of these storms will be greater in systems with large catchments relative to lake volume, particularly when significant material is available for transport from the catchment. This case illustrates the power of automated sensor networks and associated human networks in assessing both system response and the characteristics that mediate physical and ecological responses to extreme events. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={We examined plot-level interactions among nitrogen and sulfur deposition, tree type, and epiphytic diversity, biomass, and abundance in Acadia National Park (ACAD), Maine, that receives pollutant deposition and is of particular concern for biological conservation. Spruce appeared to acidify incoming deposition resulting in more concentrated inputs of nitrogen and sulfur within the canopy as well as to the soil relative to maple. This resulted in more acidic and sulfur-rich substrates and reduced biomass and species richness for cryptogamic epiphytes on spruce relative to maple. Position vertically on the tree bole was more important for epiphytes on maples than on spruces because spruces were uniform in their bark chemistry. Apparent overlap between the bark chemistry of spruce and maple, particularly for samples from higher on maple boles, suggests a reduction in the area of chemically suitable substratum for epiphytes in ACAD. Because tree species vary markedly in habitat variables important to epiphytes, stands with a mix of deciduous and evergreen trees provide the widest gradient of habitats, which appears to be reflected in the highest species richness for epiphytes occurring in mixed stands. Air quality and forest health monitoring studies utilizing epiphytes as indicators should account for the complex effects of stand-level tree species composition to better detect biological effects of deposition at the landscape scale. © 2011 The American Bryological and Lichenological Society, Inc.},

abstract={The influence of ungulate grazers on nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity in grasslands has been shown to differ with moisture, nutrient availability, and feedbacks between above- and belowground activities. We examined the movement of nitrogen (N), applied as (15NH4)2SO4, through both dry and mesic sites in the northern range of Yellowstone National Park to test the hypothesis that plants were more able to acquire added N in grazed relative to ungrazed sites. Previous studies showed enhanced N mineralization in grazed areas, and detritus removal by grazers was predicted to enhance early-season plant growth. Thirteen months after tracer addition, there were no differences in plant 15N as a function of grazing, but historically ungrazed sites retained more 15N in accumulated litter than at grazed sites. This result demonstrated the importance of detritus in regulating redistribution of incoming N and the role of grazers in this process. Site moisture status influenced 15N recovery in all pools-soils, microbial biomass, and plants-and greater plant 15N acquisition occurred in roots at dry relative to mesic sites. Understanding how grazers influence nutrient cycling at the landscape scale requires further investigation of interactions among soil moisture, plant production, litter accumulation, grazing intensity, and belowground processes. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.},

abstract={Fog is thought to influence ecological function in coastal forests worldwide, yet few data are available that illuminate the mechanisms underlying this influence. In a California redwood forest we measured water and nitrogen (N) fluxes from horizontally moving fog and vertically delivered rain as well as redwood tree function. The spatial heterogeneity of water and N fluxes, water availability, tree water use, and canopy N processing varied greatly across seasons. Water and N fluxes to soil (annual average of 98% and 89%, respectively) across the whole forest occurred primarily in the rain season and was relatively even across the whole forest. In contrast, below-canopy flux of fog water and N declined exponentially from the windward edge to the forest interior. Following large fog events, soil moisture was greater at the windward edge than anywhere else in the forest. Physiological activity in redwoods reflected these differences in inputs across seasons: tree physiological responses did not vary spatially in the rain season, but in the fog season, water use was greater, yet water stress was less, in trees at the windward edge of the forest versus the interior. In both seasons, vertical passage through the forest changed the amount of water and form and concentration of N, revealing the role of the tree canopy in processing atmospheric inputs. Although total fog water inputs were comparatively small, they may have important ecosystem functions, including relief of canopy water stress and, where there is fog drip, functional coupling of above- and belowground processes. © 2009 The Author(s).},

abstract={The persistence of rainforest patches at Fray Jorge National Park (FJNP) in semiarid Chile (30°40′S), a region receiving approximately 147mm of annual rainfall, has been a source of concern among forest managers. These forests are likely dependent on water inputs from oceanic fog and their persistence seems uncertain in the face of climate change. Here, we assessed tree radial growth and establishment during the last two centuries and their relation to trends in climate and canopy disturbance. Such evaluation is critical to understanding the dynamics of these semiarid ecosystems in response to climate change. We analyzed forest structure of six forest patches (0.2-22 ha) in FJNP based on sampling within 0.1ha permanent plots. For the main canopy species, the endemic Aextoxicon punctatum (Aextoxicaceae), we used tree-ring analysis to assess establishment periods, tree ages, growing trends and their relation to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), rainfall, and disturbance. The population dynamics of A. punctatum can be described by a continuous regeneration mode. Regeneration of A. punctatum was sensitive to different canopy structures. Growth release patterns suggest the absence of large scale human impact. Radial growth and establishment of A. punctatum were weakly correlated with rainfall and ENSO. If water limits forests patch persistence, patches are likely dependent on the combination of fog and rain water inputs. Forest patches have regenerated continuously for at least 250 years, despite large fluctuations in rainfall driven by ENSO and a regional decline in rainfall during the last century. Because of the positive influence on fog interception, forest structure should be preserved under any future climate scenario. Future research in FJNP should prioritize quantifying the long-term trends of fog water deposition on forests patches. Fog modeling is crucial for understanding the interplay among physical drivers of water inputs under climate change. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A scientific culture that welcomes a diversity of participants and addresses a broad range of questions is critical to the success of the scientific enterprise and essential for engaging the public in science. By favoring behaviors and practices that result in a narrow set of outcomes, our current scientific culture may lower the diversity of the scientific workforce, limit the range and relevance of scientific pursuits, and restrict the scope of interdisciplinary collaboration and public engagement. The scientific community will reach its full intellectual potential and secure public support through thorough, multitiered initiatives that aim to change individual and institutional behaviors, shift current reward structures to reflect a wider set of values, and explicitly consider societal benefits in the establishment of research agendas. We discuss some shortcomings and costs of the current value system and provide some guidelines for the development of initiatives that transcend such limitations. © 2007 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

abstract={Spatial and temporal heterogeneity can make ecological systems hard to understand and model. We propose a simple classification of the types of spatial and temporal complexity contained in ecological systems, and describe the kinds of data and models needed to account for each. We classify ecological systems by the presence of heterogeneity at the scale of study, the nature of their dynamics (linear vs non-linear), attributes of the patches that constitute the heterogeneous system, and the presence and directionality of interactions among patches. Heterogeneity in space and time are nearly equivalent in our framework. Advanced modeling skills are necessary to create appropriate mathematical representations of highly complex systems (with non-linear dynamics, patches with more than one kind of important attribute, or interactive patches). Simple models can work well when the scale of heterogeneity is much finer than the scale of observation, when low precision is sufficient, when patches interact only weakly, or when empirical approaches are used to fit functions and constants. Having a way to classify complexity in space and time in ecological systems should help ecologists to select modeling approaches consistent with their abilities and goals.},

abstract={Reconstruction of soil weathering is one of the more difficult problems for palaeoecologists interested in landscape-scale environmental changes. Here we use scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (SEM/EDS) to study the pitting of feldspars in soils and lake sediments at two sites in the Great Lakes region, USA. A semi-quantitative feldspar weathering index (FWI) allows description of the weathering status for large numbers of individual grains, and reveals differences among soil horizons and strata of lake sediment as well as between the two sites. Feldspars in upper soil horizons generally have greater FWI than those in lower horizons, but analyses also suggest considerable weathering in the soil C horizon at the site with more rapid water infiltration. At one site, the FWI of upper soil horizons and surface lake sediment are similar, implying that lake sediments have the potential to record changes in soil over time. However, differences between upper soil horizons and surface sediment at the other site highlight the need to examine more sites and more profiles within sites to better relate catchment and sediment characteristics. We interpret increases in the FWI over time within lake sediments as evidence of progressive weathering of soils and conclude that the sites had different histories of soil development. However, the complexities of sediment deposition in lakes and the paucity of information relating FWI to soil characteristics prevent straightforward reconstruction of soil development. Variability within each record appears tied to initial grain chemistry, depositional environment, changes in lake level and progressive degradation of grains. As more information relating micromorphology to soil characteristics becomes available, this technique should become a more useful complement to chemical studies of lake sediment.},

abstract={Comparison of vegetation, soil, and climatic history at two sites differing in soil texture and thus soil water-holding capacity reveals long-term differences in terrestrial ecosystem development. Vegetation history reconstructed using pollen analysis and modern surface samples reveals that the site on till has hosted species with higher moisture requirements than those at the outwash site since the early Holocene. The outwash site had incomplete forest cover for much of the Holocene in contrast to the till site, which likely had a closed-canopy forest for most of its history. Comparison of vegetation and soil records reveals a correspondence between the timing of changes in vegetation and soil at both sites for most of the Holocene and provides evidence for greater weathering rates under coniferous than deciduous forest or savanna. Soil and vegetation changes are synchronous within, but not across, sites 13 000-3000 yr BP, suggesting that local interactions between soil and vegetation may have been important in determining the timing of ecosystem change. In contrast, there was synchronous change in soil and vegetation across sites ∼3000 yr BP, when hemlock became established at the till site and weathering intensified at both sites. This synchrony suggests a regional driver of ecosystem change, most likely the climatic change to higher moisture availability that occurred in the late Holocene. Thus, both climate and interactions between soil and vegetation have influenced the timing of ecosystem change, and the relative importance of their influence has varied over time.},

abstract={Two geochemical techniques from soil mineralogy were used with lake sediment to reconstruct soil development in the catchments of two lakes-one on outwash and the other on till-in the Great Lakes region. A sodium pyrophosphate extraction provides information about leaching of exchangeable and organically complexed cations from terrestrial sources, while an acidified ammonium oxalate extraction removes mineral materials without well-developed crystalline structure that are indicative of podzolization. More evidence of pedogenesis is preserved in sediment of the lake on outwash- likely a result of greater retention of material within the soil profile in the catchment on till. This difference between the record suggests that excessively well-drained (leaky) catchments may provide better records of soil development than those with higher water-holding capacity. Evidence of acidification and podzolization appeared first at the lake on till and 4500 years later at the lake on outwash. Both records reveal a late Holocene intensification of weathering that coincided with a regional climatic change to greater moisture availability. The variability in weathering rates observed presents a more complex picture of weathering than the simple exponential functions often assumed in chronosequence studies. Use of lake sediment records provides better temporal resolution of significant events in soil formation than could be achieved using a chronosequence approach. © 2002 University of Washington.},
